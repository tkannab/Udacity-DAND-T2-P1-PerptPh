# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) - Term 2 - Project 1

## Project Overview

In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

If you need a refresher on statistics, you can take a free Statistics course from Udacity!

## Why this project?

Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## What will I learn?

This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

- How to identify components of an experiment
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

## Why is this important to my career?

Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a Data Analyst's work. A strong grasp of statistics will also be necessary in the rest of the Nanodegree program.

## Project Instructions

Create a pdf or html document answering the questions. These document formats are compatible across a broad range of computers and browsers and are one of the surest ways of making sure that your intents are received properly. If you are using a word processing program such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice, make sure that you save your document as a pdf and include the pdf in your project submission.

You may use whatever software tools you like for this project, but we encourage you to use the Jupyter Notebook in the Project Workspace to complete the project using Python.

## How to Complete and Submit this Project
You have two options for working on and submitting your project:

**Option #1)** On the next page, "Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project," you will see that there is a project workspace environment set up where you can do all your work on a Jupyter Notebook. This is great if you do not want to work on your local machine, or worry about system requirements. The environment will continually save your work.

If you choose this option #1, then you should also submit your project right from that workspace. You won't upload any files for your submission with this option, because the .ipynb file in the workspace will be uploaded by default. But you do still also need to provide an HTML or PDF file with your submission. There are directions in the Jupyter Notebook there in the workspace for adding your HTML or PDF file to the workspace before you submit. That HTML/PDF file will then also be included in your submission automatically.

**Option #2)** You can do your work in a Jupyter Notebook or using any other software you like, on your local machine.

If you choose this option #2, please submit your project using the button on the last page of this lesson, "Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon," where you will be able to upload your project files.

**You should choose one of these two options above - don't try to submit your project in both places**.

## Project Instructions

### Background Information

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <font color=red>RED</font>, <font color=blue>BLUE</font>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example font color=purple>PURPLE</font>, <font color=blue>ORANGE</font>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

### Questions For Investigation

As a general note, be sure to keep a record of any resources that you use or refer to in the creation of your project. You will need to report your sources as part of the project submission.

1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? Specify the null and alternative hypotheses based on what you think the researchers might be interested in. Justify your choices.

Now it’s your chance to try out the Stroop task for yourself. In order to get a better understanding of the Stroop task works, try it out yourself [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html&sa=D&ust=1520800795856000&usg=AFQjCNFS72ighy5tj6cGPwBZgYreEl_zRg).

Now, you can answer these questions directly within the classroom on the previous page, or you can download the data from the resources to complete on your local machine.

3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.

4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.

5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level or Type I error associated with your test? What is your conclusion regarding the hypotheses you set up? Did the results match up with your expectations? Hint: Think about what is being measured on each individual, and what statistic best captures how an individual reacts in each environment.

6. Optional: What do you think is responsible for the effects observed? Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar effect? Some research about the problem will be helpful for thinking about these two questions!

## Project Submission

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results. Use the [Statistics Placement Advisor](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud134-nd/l-4446458586/) to determine if reviewing any of the Statistics course will help you prepare for this project.

### Evaluation

Once you have a document answering the questions on the previous page, be sure to check through the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/4582204201/rubric) before you submit your report. Your project will be evaluated as “meets specifications” only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see any category where you do not meet specifications, make sure you revise your report to meet the rubric criteria.

### Submission

Ready to submit your project? Collect the following files:

- A PDF or HTML file with answers to the 5 questions that were posed in the Project Notebook and on the previous page.
- A list of websites, books, forums, GitHub repositories, and other resources (web or otherwise) that you referred to or used in this submission. This can be attached to the bottom of your answers document or placed in a separate plain text file (add N/A if not included).
- (Optional) Any code or other documents that you used to compute statistics for completing the project tasks.

Then click on the Submit Project button at the bottom of this page.

- If you want to submit your files through a "Link to Project", upload your project files onto Github and send us the link.
- If you instead want to submit your files through "Upload a Zip", compress your project directory, and submit that zip file.
